# Life Fruit - Reforked
This mod adds the Life Fruit from Terraria to Minecraft. 
They are generated in the lush caves, and eating them increases the player's max health.
The Ender Dragon Fruit also has the same effect, but it only works after consuming the Life Fruit.


## Reforked Version Special Changes
This fork is based on the original 1.0.6 version.   
In the original mod, after eating lifefruit or dragonfruit,
the player can only regenerate those parts of additional health by eating food.  
The reforked version changed this mechanic by adding healing and regeneration compat.
Now instant healing, life stealing and regeneration should properly work for lifefruit and dragonfruit health.

## TODO
Add compat for more regeneration-like potion effects in other mods.
